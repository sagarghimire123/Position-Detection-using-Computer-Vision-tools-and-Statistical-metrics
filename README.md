            1. Enhancement
            2. Sharpening with sobel
            3. Segmentation of POI using k-mean and mean shift
            4. Binarized the segmented
            5. Multiply the binarized with enhanced and sharpened image
            6. Calculate the hist of POI for one of the image from the particular class(ready and not ready)
            7. Compare the hist value with other images POI using
            i. Chi-squared
            ii. correlation coefficient
